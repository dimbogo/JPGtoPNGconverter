# JPGtoPNGconverter
this script helps you to convert images from JPEG to PNG format

1) to make it work you have to place the file into the parent directory which has the required nested folder with images
2) then you need to run the file through the command line giving 2 arguments: 1st is the name of folder with images and 2nd is the name of new folder with converted images witch you want to create (if such folder already exists converted images will be saved in it)
